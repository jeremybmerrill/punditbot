These claims are stupid. They have no predictive power. Let's mock them.

TODO:
  - should `The Republicans have in every year bears killed more than 10 people won the White House.` have commas or switch `have` and the complement, e.g. `The Republicans, in every year bears killed more than 10 people, have won the White House.`?
  - add categorical data sets
  - add support for candidate based exceptoins ("Without a Clinton on the ballot, ")
  - ensure NLG system generates all varieties that were templated out.
  - remove linguistics stuff from everything NLG parts (so there's no "verb phrase" in constants)
